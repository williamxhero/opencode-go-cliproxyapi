# OpenCode Go CLIProxyAPI Plugin

A native dynamic Go plugin for [CLIProxyAPI](https://help.router-for.me/plugin/development) that exposes OpenCode Go as a single provider (`opencode-go`).

The plugin unifies model discovery, protocol translation, and execution across OpenCode Go's upstream endpoints while leveraging CLIProxyAPI's built-in authentication, scheduling, keys rotation, and cooldown management.

## The Problem

OpenCode Go exposes models across multiple API protocols (OpenAI Chat Completions `/v1/chat/completions`, Anthropic Messages `/v1/messages`, and OpenAI Responses `/v1/responses`).

Without this plugin, using OpenCode Go in CLIProxyAPI requires configuring separate provider blocks for each protocol family. This leads to:
- **Duplicated configuration & keys**: The same API keys must be configured across multiple provider blocks.
- **Fragmented scheduling & rotation**: Keys rotation, rate limits, and cooldowns cannot be shared across protocols—exhausting quota on one protocol does not coordinate with another.
- **Client protocol burden**: Clients must know beforehand which upstream protocol and endpoint each model requires.
- **Fragmented catalog**: Models are split across disjoint provider namespaces instead of a unified model list.

## The Solution

This plugin exposes OpenCode Go as a single provider (`opencode-go`) backed by a shared keys pool:
- **Unified auth pool**: Configure keys once; CLIProxyAPI schedules, rotates, and cools down keys across all protocols.
- **Transparent protocol translation & routing**: Clients request models (e.g. `opencode-go/glm-5.2`, `opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna`) without needing to know the upstream protocol format.
- **Single model catalog**: All models are discovered and published under the `opencode-go` provider namespace in `/v1/models`.

## Features

- **Single Provider Namespace**: Exposes models under the `opencode-go` provider prefix (e.g. `opencode-go/glm-5.2`, `opencode-go/qwen3.7-max`, `opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna`).
- **Multi-Protocol Translation**: Translates requests and streaming responses between client formats and upstream endpoints:
  - OpenAI Chat Completions (`/v1/chat/completions`)
  - Anthropic Messages (`/v1/messages`)
  - OpenAI Responses (`/v1/responses`)
- **Thinking & Reasoning Support**: Maps reasoning effort across supported client and upstream formats.
- **Dynamic Catalog Discovery**: Fetches remote model catalogs with local fallback and custom route overrides.
- **Multi-Key Auth Scheduling**: Pools multiple API keys with CLIProxyAPI's native scheduler for rotation, retries, and error cooldowns across all protocols.
- **Native quotas**: Rolling, weekly, and monthly quotas use CLIProxyAPI’s generic quota endpoints and the selected credential. A compatibility resource page is also exposed for older Management Center builds.

## Requirements

- **CLIProxyAPI**: `v8.0.0+`
- **Go Toolchain**: Go 1.26.7+ (with CGO enabled for C-shared build mode)

## Build

Build the dynamic shared library for your platform:

### Windows (AMD64)
```powershell
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/windows/amd64/opencode-go-cliproxyapi.dll .
```

### Linux (AMD64)
```bash
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/linux/amd64/opencode-go-cliproxyapi.so .
```

### macOS (ARM64)
```bash
go build -buildmode=c-shared -o plugins/darwin/arm64/opencode-go-cliproxyapi.dylib .
```

Place the compiled binary into your CLIProxyAPI plugin directory (e.g. `<cliproxyapi_root>/plugins/<os>/<arch>/`).

## Configuration

Configure the plugin in your CLIProxyAPI `config.yaml` under `plugins.configs.opencode-go-cliproxyapi`:

```yaml
plugins:
  configs:
    opencode-go-cliproxyapi:
      # Upstream base URL (default: "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1")
      base-url: "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1"

      # Optional catalog endpoint override (default: "{base-url}/models")
      # catalog-url: "https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models"

      # Client-facing model ID prefix configuration
      model-prefix:
        enabled: true           # true -> "opencode-go/<model>", false -> bare "<model>" (default: true)
        value: "opencode-go"    # prefix name (default: "opencode-go")

      # OpenCode Go API keys (at least one required). Supports ${ENV_VAR} expansion.
      api-keys:
        - value: "sk-opencode-key-1"
          name: "Personal"      # optional account label
        - value: "sk-opencode-key-2"
        - value: "${OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY}"

      # Catalog discovery settings
      catalog:
        refresh-interval: "15m"          # discovery refresh cadence, min "1m" (default: "15m")
        stale-while-unavailable: true    # retain last good catalog snapshot on refresh failure (default: true)

      # Protocol enable/disable switches (all default to true)
      protocols:
        chat-completions: true   # enables models routed to /v1/chat/completions
        messages: true           # enables models routed to /v1/messages
        responses: true          # enables models routed to /v1/responses

      # Explicit route overrides per model (takes priority over built-in prefix routing)
      route-overrides:
        "custom-model":
          protocol: "messages"           # "chat-completions" | "messages" | "responses"
          endpoint: "/v1/messages"       # must start with /

      # Execution settings
      request-timeout: "5m"              # upstream request timeout (default: "5m")
      max-response-bytes: 67108864       # max non-streaming response body size in bytes (default: 64 MiB)
      allow-http: false                  # allow http:// scheme for local mock/testing (default: false)
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api-keys` | `[]object` | *(Required)* | List of API keys (`- value: "..."`, optional `name: "Personal"`). Supports `${ENV_VAR}` expansion. Duplicates and empty values are rejected. |
| `base-url` | `string` | `https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1` | Upstream base URL. Must be valid HTTPS (or HTTP if `allow-http: true`) without query parameters, fragments, or userinfo. |
| `catalog-url` | `string` | `{base-url}/models` | Full URL for catalog discovery. Defaults to `{base-url}/models`. |
| `model-prefix.enabled` | `bool` | `true` | When `true`, client-facing model names use `<prefix>/<model>`. When `false`, uses bare model IDs. |
| `model-prefix.value` | `string` | `opencode-go` | Provider prefix string when prefixing is enabled. |
| `catalog.refresh-interval` | `duration` | `15m` | Interval between catalog polling refreshes (e.g. `15m`, `1h`). Minimum is `1m`. |
| `catalog.stale-while-unavailable` | `bool` | `true` | When `true`, serves the last valid catalog snapshot if an update fails. |
| `protocols.chat-completions` | `bool` | `true` | Protocol switch for Chat Completions endpoints. |
| `protocols.messages` | `bool` | `true` | Protocol switch for Messages endpoints. |
| `protocols.responses` | `bool` | `true` | Protocol switch for Responses endpoints. |
| `route-overrides` | `map` | `{}` | Map of model ID to `{ protocol: "...", endpoint: "..." }` overriding built-in family routing. Valid protocols: `chat-completions`, `messages`, `responses`. |
| `request-timeout` | `duration` | `5m` | Upstream HTTP request timeout. Must be positive. |
| `max-response-bytes` | `int64` | `67108864` (64 MiB) | Maximum non-streaming response body size in bytes. |
| `allow-http` | `bool` | `false` | When `true`, permits `http://` scheme in `base-url` / `catalog-url` for local testing. |

### Keeping the model list aligned with OpenCode Go

The plugin replaces its `opencode-go` catalog with the latest successful
response from OpenCode Go. Models removed upstream therefore disappear from
the next successful refresh. The refresh interval is configurable, with a
minimum of one minute.

For a strict mirror, use a short interval and fail closed during an outage:

```yaml
catalog:
  refresh-interval: "1m"
  stale-while-unavailable: false
```

`stale-while-unavailable: true` is safer during a transient outage, but it
intentionally keeps the last successful model list until the next refresh.
Models whose upstream protocol is not known to the plugin are retained in
refresh diagnostics and excluded from `opencode-go` models. Add a
`route-overrides` entry only when the upstream protocol is confirmed; the
plugin does not guess a route for an unknown model.

## Testing

```powershell
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Run linter / vetting
go vet ./...
```

## Adding credentials from a management form

With the plugin enabled, submit a management-authenticated request to
`POST /v0/management/plugins/opencode-go-cliproxyapi/credentials`:

```json
{"base_url":"https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1","api_key":"oc_sk_dummy_example","name":"Personal"}
```

The response is `{"ok":true,"id":"opencode-go-key-<hash>","label":"Personal"}`.
`base_url` and a non-empty `api_key` are required; `name` defaults to **OpenCode Go**.
Unknown fields are ignored. URLs must use HTTPS (HTTP requires `allow-http: true`)
and contain a host, with no userinfo, query, or fragment. The key is never returned.
A duplicate key plus normalized base URL returns HTTP 409. Invalid input returns
400; unavailable host credential support returns 503; host inspection/save errors
return 502 with redacted reasons.

Credentials are persisted through the host auth API as provider `opencode-go`,
with the supplied label and their own `base_url`. Execution prefers selected auth
attributes, then stored credential JSON, then the configured `base-url`; quota
fetches also use the credential URL. Legacy configured quota `key_id` values are
unchanged, and form credentials are included in the compatibility quota list.
Form credential filenames use the returned hash ID plus `.json`.

At least one configured `api-keys` entry is still required for plugin startup and
catalog discovery; form credentials do not change the global model catalog.
The host's current save callback is not transactional and exposes no rollback
API: host-side disk/upsert failures may leave a partial file. The plugin publishes
no local credential state on failure and waits for the save result rather than
returning a timeout while a mutating callback continues.

## Account names and quotas

Set an optional `name` on each `api-keys` entry, alongside `value`.
For example, use `name: Personal` or `name: Work`. Without a name, one key
uses **OpenCode Go**; multiple keys use **OpenCode Go 1**, **OpenCode Go 2**, and subsequent numbers.
Default numbers follow configuration order. Explicit names remain stable when keys are reordered.
The usage response contains no email or account identity. The plugin does not infer an email from a key.

Configured credential files have readable names. Existing auth IDs remain unchanged, and
legacy generated labels are replaced when parsed. Existing custom labels are preserved
unless configuration specifies a name. Existing filenames are retained automatically;
stop CLIProxyAPI before renaming an old file to a readable `.json` filename, and keep
its JSON `id` and all other fields unchanged. Back up the file first.

Discover support with `GET /v0/management/quota/providers`, then call
`POST /v0/management/quota/fetch` with `{"auth_index":"<selected index>"}`.
These endpoints require the CLIProxyAPI management key. The normalized response contains
`subscription.plan`, `groups[].buckets[].window`, `remainingFraction`, and `resetTime`.
Missing windows are omitted. Invalid readings return an error, not an invented zero.
Quota reset is unsupported. For older Management Center builds, the plugin also exposes a compatibility quota resource page backed by the same native quota provider.
